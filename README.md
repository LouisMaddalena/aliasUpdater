# aliasUpdater
Creates aliases for folder structure for easy directory changes in the terminal.


I have a numbered folder structure that I use to keep track and organize my doduments.   Its a pretty simple system where each folder gets a number (for a few levels at least). 

Here is an example:
I have a folder where I keep my coding projects in,  it is in a root folder where every folder has a 2 digit folder number, my coding foloder is folder 50 and apppears as "50_Code", a number and a name.
Within the code foler I have a few other folders "51_CS_Projects" and "52_Workflows" for example.   I have another folder "53_Utilities" this is where I keep scripts I have created for my day to day life
within "53_Utilities" I have more folders, one of which is "533_Management" which is the third folder in the utilities folder.   By now, you likely get the idea. I am a nerd on many levels, one of which 
is organization. 

Anyway,  Now I spend a lot of time in various folders, and I also spend a lot of time in the command line.   Its annoying to type out full file paths if I know what I really need is in folder 2111 for example
or if I am navigating between 533 and 513 on a regular basis.  When I am deep on a project, having the numbers gives saves me mental space and also accelerates my abilities to move around. 

But I wanted to get to these folders, even faster, enter a script that creates aliases for me to move around,  now when I type 50 into my command line, it automatically brings me to the directory for "50_code", 
but what if I add a handful of new folders for some projects, or if I decide I need to depreciate a folder number.  The idea of having to chase these aliases annoyed me.... enter Python. 

That is what the script is all about.  Hopefully there is at least one other orginizational nerd out there who wants to use this script, if not its here for myself incase I lose it,  not that I ever would.
